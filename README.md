# Task-Calender
This is a python application that will take in a user's required task, put them on a calendar, and then if the process is on the user's computer, open the application automatically at the designated time.

To run this application, you must first create a 'config.json' file in the 'main' folder. In this file you must put the following,

{
    "discord_path": "[Discord path]"
}

Once this is done you may run the app.
